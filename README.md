# Medicine Delivery 

This is a freelance project done for a chemist shop in need for an application to make orders to our remote colony. It has the following features:

- [X] Placing an order (user side)
- [X] Monitoring orders
- [X] Order verification and completion
- [X] Inventory management
- [X] Order management (user and admin side)

This project helped raise money for upgrading the chemist shop owner, who was previously a small business owner.
